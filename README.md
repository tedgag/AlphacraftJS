# AlphacraftJS

Simple Galaga-style 3D game developed using a 3D rendering engine built from scratch in JavaScript.

Most of the main features of the renderer were built following Gabriel Gambetta's ["Computer Graphics from scratch"](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/introduction.html) and the rest was implemented after some quick research on the internet. The goal of this project was mostly to understand how 3D libraries such as OpenGL work behind the scene to solidify my base knowledge in computer graphics.

This renderer features:
* Rasterization
* Perspective projection
* Shading (Phong)
* Point, directional and ambient lighting
* Hierarchical modeling
* Hidden surface removal (Per-triangle model cliping and depth buffering)
* Texture mapping
